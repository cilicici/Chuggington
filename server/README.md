## Nodejs server

To use nodejs server you need to install dependencies run command:

```bash
npm install
```

To start development run command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To start application run command:

```bash
npm run start
```

To start tests run command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Application will run on http://localhost:5000/. If you pass that link to the browser it will open react application, but first you need to build it.

On link http://localhost:5000/api-docs/ is swagger documentation of application API.
